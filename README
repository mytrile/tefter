Piggyback, or scratching my own itch.

I was looking for some simple expenses tracking solution, unfortunately none found.

At the same time I wish to build something I will actually use.

Along with this, I wish to train myself into UI design. 

So it is a win-win-win situation :)

Envisioning the product

* It should support posting expenses in different categories
* It should give some stats for the current month, and overall
---
* It should support multiple currencies (with web service, hopefully)
* It may involve accounts, though not needed.
